# Handouts
These handouts are meant to supplement lecture material for PHYS 240 (Computational Physics) in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.uwec.edu/academics/college-arts-sciences/departments-programs/physics-astronomy/) at the [University of Wisconsinâ€“Eau Claire](https://uwec.edu).

While they may be useful as stanalone Jupyter notebooks, they were mostly intended to be consumed as slideshows using [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). If you install RISE and then open a notebook, you can enter the slideshow by pressing `alt`/`option`-`R`, and then move around the slideshow with `space` and `shift` `space`.
