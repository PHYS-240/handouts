    "    - Google \"matplotlib errboar asymmetric\" or something similar; usually an excellent stack overflow qustion\n",

    "- **Create a styleguide**\n",
    "    - Creat your own `matplotlibrc` file that you include in the same directory as projects\n",
    "    - Get basic one [here](https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html#a-sample-matplotlibrc-file). Copy into a file with the name `matplotlibrc` in the same directory, and `matplotlib` will use the styles you define there as the default."
